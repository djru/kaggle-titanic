# Kaggle Titanic Model

This is my solution for Kaggle's Titanic Competition. It uses dummy variables for gender, age (over/under age 12), having a parent on board, having a sibling on board, and economic class. Using support vector machines, these features yield an accuracy of between 0.79 and 0.81. Random forests give similar results, and and the rest of the classification methods I tried yielded slightly worse results.
